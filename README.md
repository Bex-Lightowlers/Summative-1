# Technical Documentation

## Summative 1 
This script runs maths equations. It includes the following:

- Using function `equation_gen()` to generate the equation:
  ```
  a * x = b
  ```
  The functions used are as below:
  ```
  def equation_gen():

    '''
    This code will ask the user 5 maths questions and 
    at the end will give a score out of 5.
    '''
    unknown_x = random.randint(1, 10) # Code for x
    coef_a = random.randint(1, 10) # Code for equation
    result = coef_a * unknown_x # Answer
    return f"{coef_a} * x = {result}", unknown_x
  ```
- It generates random numbers using `ramdom.randit(1, 10)` for a & x which equates to b. 
- Prompts the user to input their answer using `input()`
- Generates 5 questions using `i in range(5)`
- Provides immediate feedback if correct or incorrect by using `if-else` statement
- At the end, displaced overall score.
